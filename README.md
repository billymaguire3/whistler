## Whistler is a social networking app similar to twitter
This project was developed using extreme programming (XP) principles including Test Driven Development and simple design. I chose React as my library to enforce the prinicple of modular design allowing me to test certain components one at a time as I move forward with the project.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `Within npm test`

#### `a`

Follow instructions for which key to press to test what you would like. Simply pressing 'a' will run all tests.

#### 'w'

After you first run the test script from the CLI, you may press 'w' to watch for any of the necessary files and if any are saved, it will run all tests again.
